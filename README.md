# Follow-me-Drone
An intelligent follow-me drone based on CNN and ROS.

### Things to do

* Evaluate all possible visual tracking algorithms
* Introduce a controller
* Introduce Kalman Filter to make tracking more robust
* Use multiple bots in Gazebo simulator for virtual verification

#### Notes
* Current implementation is based on in built OpenCV trackers
* All implementation is done in ```visual_follow.py``` file
